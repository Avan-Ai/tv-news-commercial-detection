## Dataset

This project uses the TV News Channel Commercial Detection Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains features extracted from 150 hours of TV news broadcasts from 5 different channels (3 Indian and 2 International news channels).

## Project Components

### 1. Preprocessing
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature extraction
- Data normalization
- Train-test split

### 2. Processing
- Model development
- Training and validation
- Model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Visualization
- Data distribution plots
- Feature importance visualization
- Model performance metrics
- Results presentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

4. Follow the workflow:
   - Start with preprocessing scripts
   - Move to processing and model development
   - Create visualizations for results

## Team Collaboration

This project is designed for team collaboration. Each team should:
- Work on their assigned component
- Follow Git workflow practices
- Document their code
- Create pull requests for review

## Learning Objectives

1. Git and GitHub workflow
2. Team collaboration
3. Data preprocessing techniques
4. Machine learning model development
5. Data visualization
6. Project documentation
