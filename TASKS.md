2. Processing time for new data is under 1 second
3. All visualizations are clear and informative
4. Code is well-documented and maintainable
5. Project can be easily reproduced by others

## Timeline
- Week 1: Data preprocessing and initial analysis
- Week 2: Model development and training
- Week 3: Visualization and documentation
- Week 4: Testing, optimization, and final presentation

## Notes
- Each team should create their own branch for development
- Regular commits and pull requests are required
- Code should be well-documented
- Team members should review each other's code
- Regular progress updates should be shared
